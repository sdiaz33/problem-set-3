      DID YOU KNOW? : The polar bear is the largest and most carnivorous member of the bear family.
      <h2>
        Range and Habitat
      </h2>
      <p>
        Polar bears are only found in the Artic. The most important habitats for polar bears are the edges of pack ice where currents and wind interact, forming a continually melting and refreezing matrix of ice patches and leads (open spaces in the ocean between sea ice). These are the areas of where polar bears can find the greatest number of seals.
        As the sea ice advances and retreats each season, individual polar bears may travel thousands of miles per yearto find food. Polar bears are distributed throughout the Arctic region in 19 subpopulations, including Alaska, Canada, Russia, Greenland, and Norway.

        Diet
      </h2>
      <p>
        Polar bears feed almost exclusively on ringed seals and bearded seals. They are also known to eat walrus, beluga whale, and bowhead whale carcasses, bird' eggs, and rarely vegetation. Polar bears travel great distances in search of prey.

        Population and Behavior
      </h2>
      <p>
        Polar bears are highly dependent on older stable pack ice in the Arctic region, where they spend much of their time on the ice hunting, mating, and denning. They ar generally solitary as adults, except during breeding and cub rearing. Polar bears are strong swimmers, and individuals have been seen in open Arctic water as far as 200 miles from land, although swimming long distances is not preferred since it requires so much energy for adults and can be fatal to younger bears. In addition, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) estimates that there are between 20,000-25,000 polar bears in the world.
