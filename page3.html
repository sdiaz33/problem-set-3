        Environment
      </h2>
        Polar bears are only found in the Artic. The most important habitats for polar bears are the edges of pack ice where currents and wind interact, forming a continually melting and refreezing matrix of ice patches and leads (open spaces in the ocean between sea ice). These are the areas of where polar bears can find the greatest number of seals.
        As the sea ice advances and retreats each season, individual polar bears may travel thousands of miles per yearto find food. Polar bears are distributed throughout the Arctic region in 19 subpopulations, including Alaska, Canada, Russia, Greenland, and Norway.

        Diet
      </h2>
        Polar bears feed almost exclusively on ringed seals and bearded seals. They are also known to eat walrus, beluga whale, and bowhead whale carcasses, bird' eggs, and rarely vegetation. Polar bears travel great distances in search of prey.
